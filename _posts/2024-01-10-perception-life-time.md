## Introduction
Start 0f `2 0 2 4`... What a great time to open a random blog and discuss about the concept of time, now that everyone is putting faith in the new year and hoping to receive happiness.

This article doesn't use ChatGPT or similar textual AIs in any way, I decided to write it completely on my own, with the help of [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) to correct translation errors.

> Hey Erik, 2023 really sucked for me, I can't wait for December 31, so that 2024 comes and at least I can hope that the next year will be better.

> ~ R

I've been thinking about this for a while, and I've come up with the idea that the common thought among people is that, on December 31, if it was a good year, we hope for a year that is equal in happiness or even better, and vice versa, if things didn't go well, we want to move away from the old year and put our trust in the future.

Personally, I didn't do much on the last day of 2023, I was still weighed down by the family Christmas lunch cooked by my beloved Italian grandmother (the stereotype is true, if you know what I mean).

## Time is relative
Let's start with the simple things: what is 1 year? There is no single definition of what a year is unless we specify its type, and we can cite among the examples:
1. The Gregorian year, used in modern calendars, where there are 365 days every year, but every 4 years they become 366 days, however every 100 years the days become 365, but if the year is a multiple of 400 then the days are 366, and eventually the big bad wolf comes and kills us all.
2. The solar year, that corresponds to the actual rotation of the earth around the sun, which lasts `365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds`. But how? Doesn't the earth's rotation last 1 year? Yes, 1 solar year. Since we are not smart enough to count years with this precision, we approximated them using the Gregorian calendar. However, it would be something like "Tonight at `04:45:57` (random hour by the way) everyone up celebrating the rotation of the earth around the sun", and that wouldn't accurate too, because in the world there are `24` timezones in total, so people in the world have 24 different New Year parties for 24 different moments.
3. The Julian year, which corresponds to `365.25` days (365d 8h) because it's a cool number: SPQR, Ancients Romans!

It's important to specify that the year is a human-defined measure and it doesn't exist in nature (it was defined from the earth's rotation around the sun but the universe is so vast that we are nothing in comparison).
There is no clear distinction between one year and another in reality, and in no case as if by magic will one year necessarily go well for us and another year go horribly wrong because of fate.

What is certain for **US** is that the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening, creating a cycle that in the long run gives rise to a stream of earth days, and **WE** perceive the days this way.

However, this is only our point of view.

Let's take light as an example, which travels at approximately `300,000 km/s` (the Earth's equatorial circumference is `~40,000km`, so light speed is something like going around the entire Earth `7.5` times every second).
In the duration of a Julian year, a photon of light travels through space 1 light-year (this is also a convention established by man).

Now, to simplify Einstein's theory of relativity (don't kill me if you're a physicist please), if we ourselves were that photon of light (which, let's remember, seems to be an absolutely massless particle), for the human observing us, our path lasted 1 year in **HIS** passage of time, but for us who moved at the speed of light, that year would have passed in a moment, we wouldn't even notice it, because from our point of view, time flows much faster.

The year is such because we observe it that way, but if we traveled at a high enough speed or lived near an object of enormous mass (e.g., black hole), we would have other units of measurement for time because we wouldn't even notice the passing of 1 Earth year.

## Life is short
If we approximate the duration of the universe to [13.787 billion years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe), as scientists have estimated, and compare it to the entire history of man on earth (about [2 million years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_history)), we realize the huge difference between the 2 numbers: 2,000,000 vs. 13,787,000,000 years. Comparing it in %, we can say that the history of all humans, from the first ape to us, occupies only `0.0145%` of the life of the universe to date, and, our life span alone of about `100 years` is practically insignificant, corresponding to `0.000000725%` of the history of the universe (many 0s, right?).
To make the idea better, if we consider the history of the universe as a 24-hour clock, our entire 100 year lifetime (hopefully, at least) corresponds to 0.0006 seconds (less than 1 millisecond).

Are we important enough for this millisecond to be remembered in the future compared to the other 24 hours, or will it take a few years and everything we have built will be forgotten? Since the great ancient Romans, only `2000 years` have passed (or `12 milliseconds` in our virtual clock), they were the masters of the world, yet of all the people who lived during that time, we barely remember a couple of things we learned in school about Julius Caesar. So much has happened in this short period of time that it's impossible to know even a fraction of it, and the people of the future will behave the same way with us: we will be the people whose information has been lost over 2000 years, and our computers will be the archaeological finds used to reconstruct information about our society (it's not a coincidence that GitHub made a copy of all the open source code, [putting it in the middle of the ice](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/)).

## A life well lived
Are you already preparing to digest the last paragraph by swallowing gallons of Alcohol to forget? Don't.
We are the ones who decide what to do and what paths to take, and happiness in doing something we enjoy depends mainly on us.

Aside from the rare cases where you are in debt up to our necks or you are in a really bad situation that is beyond your control (physical or psychological), most of life's problems come from the little everyday things.
We are the architects of ourselves; if we feel fulfilled in our lives, we can appreciate what we have instead of continuing to suffer in unhappiness.

Considering our period of time to spend on earth as insignificant compared to the entire history of the universe, the significance we assign to it depends entirely on ourselves.

If we ask different people about the meaning of life, we will get very different answers:
- **To a Hindu**: `"I live to reincarnate into a better person and relive a new life"`
- **To an italian**: `"I live to eat pizza and pay â‚¬50 a day for a beach umbrella at beach establishments"`
- **To a child**: `"I live to play and have fun"`
- **To a 70 year old employee**: `"I live to enjoy retirement and rest after a lifetime of work"`

Ooops, the last one comes from Rick & Morty Season 3.

If at a certain time you haven't assigned yourself a purpose in life, whether small or big, you will most likely feel lost and you won't be happy with the moments you live, because you don't know where ou are going, there isn't a destination.

### Importance of Randomness
As far as we know, life is unpredictable, and because of this unpredictability, both positive and negative things happen to us from time to time.
However, can we, by our decisions, influence the percentage of positive events so that they outweigh the negative ones?

The perfect word to describe this is `boh`, which in Italian means `I don't know`.
Certainly, however, we can try to change our situation, and if we surrend to the plan that fate has in store for us, we likely remain stuck in our starting position (social position, economic position, knowledge about something, etc. ) and the chances of improving it diminish dramatically.
Here I'm assuming that you could believe in the nonexistence of fate, but there is also the possibility that fate showed you this article to let you understand that you need to do something about your life, and the fact that you are reading this article is written in your destiny.

### Long Peace
In the past 80 years there has been basically no war in the West.
It took "only" 2 huge wars in 30 years, and millions of deaths, to achieve this much desired peace.
We are in one of the most peaceful periods in recent history (at least in the last `2000 years`), and just being born in a rich country, with a good life expectancy and in a relatively peaceful period can tell us that we live pretty high in the standard of living of human beings.

As George Orwell wrote in `1984`, by having Goldstein tell it in his book, in that dystopian world, endless war served to destroy the wealth created by people's productivity, because if wealth improved people's lives, it would be much harder for the government to control them.

Applying his reasoning to reality, in this last period of peace we have produced [10 times](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-gdp-over-the-last-two-millennia) more wealth than all previous years combined.

> Famous is the quote that, with the progress of science, the average person in the West today lives even better than a king a few centuries ago.

### Target: Becoming Rich
So, you have decided that your next goal to achieve in life is to become a very rich person.

Very well, you are free to try it in our capitalist world, if you succeed (and this is not sure), you don't have to work in your life unwillingly anymore (and that is not always the case, maybe you love the work you are doing, I do).
You probably won't stop working altogether right away but will devote yourself to what you enjoy, you will be more willing to take risks in your choices because it doesn't depend solely on your current job position.

However, what if I told you that obsession with getting rich is not everything? You certainly won't become important in the long run if you only get a little money.

The richest people of the past have been forgotten today and their descendants have spent all the wealth, there is no family that has held wealth for a thousand years or more, or even if there were, it would not be a significant percentage compared to all the others who didn't make it.

A person like Jeff Bezos (Amazon founder) will end up in history books in the next few years, but in `2,000 years` who knows if he will still be known.
Today in school we learn the names of all the greatest emperors of the past, but we have no idea who the richest people of the time were, maybe a few archaeologists know but not common people.

Assuming that you can keep some wealth for thousands of years, in what form would you keep it? A bad investment would still have you holding nothing.

If you keep physical banknotes, since they no longer have any real underlying value and more and more is issued over time (in Roman times, currency was physically gold so value existed in its own).

If you were a Roman, you would then have thought that salt, `natrium`, was a good investment, so much so that workers received it as wages (salt -> salary), today you can find it at very low prices in all supermarkets.

Then in more recent times there was the [diamond scandal](https://mediavsreality.medium.com/diamonds-the-greatest-marketing-campaign-of-all-time-8c4b0fd27092). The world is full of diamonds, really full, and a shortage was artificially created in order to raise the price of diamonds by a lot (perception was everything), manipulating the market while meanwhile the biggest companies had warehouses full of them.

### Average among riches or rich among poors
Although the idea of being richer than average may seem appealing to you, would you want to be equally so if you lived in a poor country?
By rich here I don't mean multimillionaire, just richer than average, wealthy in that particular country.

In poorer countries usually the average level of wealth of the population is significantly lower, and it is not even certain that you can find supermarkets nearby.

Same with health care, you can easily afford to shell out all the money necessary to have the care of a private doctor, but this service may not necessarily be there, because the people who can afford it are so few that a doctor would have no convenience in offering this service.

Living in a poor country, paradoxically, you can find yourself having a certain amount of money without being able to spend it the way you want. You also have to consider the possible extortion you would receive as a rich person in a poor country, the threats you would receive from other people, and the real possibility of being kidnapped.

On the opposite, living in a rich country as an average person you would be exactly like everyone else. You wake up, go to work every day, come home at night, and the years go by.
Probably, if you live in the United States, you would go into debt to show yourself better than your neighbors (something like "dress to impress"), I recommend reading the book ["The Millionaire Next Door"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Millionaire_Next_Door) that talks about this topic, by the way.

A good compromise would be to live in a developed but not too expensive country, to retire to a quiet life when you have a certain amount of money.
For example, in earlier years in Italy retirees would move to Portugal (I'm not sure Portugal is still like that, considering the crazy rent prices there today) or to the coast of Tunisia, where they can find a `favorable climate` and `lower prices`.

### Work to live or live to work?
So, you are so happy in your company that you decide to devote extra hours to work for free.
Next year maybe you will take a `$1,000` productivity bonus and be disappointed because you thought you deserved more, if not even a promotion.
The CEO of the company will get a new house with his multimillion dollar annual bonus, and you'll think you haven't done enough, and you'll continue to work above your abilities.

> But I love my job!

Try to find a hobby that gives you as much satisfaction, something has to be there, you really risk burnout.

While we were busy unsuccessfully climbing the corporate pyramid, our family members, and our loved ones, were the ones supporting us in the shadows, and they will keep our memory longer after we die, until they die too. Make that memory at least a positive one.

> But it's only a temporary situation!

It's never a temporary situation unless you make a clean break with the past, not only in this specific case but in any generic situation.

Separate discussion if, on the other hand, one is in a really lucrative field that is significantly better than normal work.
I give the example of the Software Developer: effectively if you move to California, Google and other big tech offer job positions that pay as much as `$500,000` annually or more, provided you have a certain level of experience that few people can achieve.
Now, if a person decides to work for a predetermined amount of time (e.g. `5 years`) in one of these well-paying jobs (or even being a C-Suite manager: CEO, CTO, etc.), and meets the deadline after that time is up, devoting himself to something else with the accumulated savings, and this effectively would be a temporary situation.

But it's you who controls the direction of life, and if you have a certain influence by doing something, you almost develop an addiction to it, you live to have gratification from someone else.

### Target: Modern Darwinism
`John Doe: "The only purpose of human beings is to procreate as much as possible and generate other human beings who will spread our DNA"`

What if this is our purpose in life? To create many small copies of ourselves to spread our genes?

Our friend Jonathan from the Netherlands followed Charles Darwin's teachings to the letter and applied them to the modern world. Through anonymous sperm donation, he has delivered between `550` and `600` babies, making many more donations than normal to pursue his goal.

He did it so well that someone dedicated a page to him on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Jacob_Meijer) and various newspaper articles around the world mention that a court has banned it from being able to make children anymore through this method.

Do you really want to go that far?

### Yourself

#### Carbon
Humans are creatures composed primarily of carbon, by means of organized structures called cells grouped into organs.
The main organ is the brain, which has no soul and perceives the world using chemical signals called neurotransmitters.

Thought itself is merely a chemical reaction.

#### Soul
God created Adam and Eve, who committed original sin.
You are the descendant of this long dynasty of sinners, but God loves everyone for who they are.

#### Science vs Religion
When we die, the chemical signals gradually slow down, sometimes we have pre-death visions due to the release of DMT by our brain, and we believe we have seen some god speaking to us. The body dies due to the inability to continue cellular reproduction, and we become food for the underground bacteria.

Our soul ascends to heaven, and rejoins our departed loved ones. Life is not over, it has just begun; we left our mortal body to live in eternity.
You have lived a life in misery, and now you have become `homo novus` because of your faith.

### Spiritual Business
```
Religion is the opium of the people

~ Karl Marx
```

Hope in an afterlife helps to alleviate people's suffering in everyday life.

#### Cruel Religion
If you are not fully satisfied with your life, what can convince you to abandon it completely, forever?

Money? Nope, you are going to die, what would you need it for?

For glory? Mmmm maybe, in World War II Japanese kamikaze plane pilots committed suicide against American ships to make their nation great.

For a life after death where you end up alone with 72 virgin girls if you sacrifice for Allah's holy war?
> Where do I have to sign? ;) (just joking)

And this is how terrorist groups recruit people, on the large numbers surely someone believes.

And, at least in Europe, the fear of `ISIS` is still widespread, so much so that even my grandma knows this terrible name (seriously). Here are a couple of recent news stories:
- Paris, France (Nov. 2015), the famous [Bataclan attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks), the biggest modern terrorism attack after 2001, `137 deaths` and more than `400` people injured.
- Milan, Italy (Nov. 2023), [suspected ISIS terrorist arrested in the metro](https://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2023/11/09/algerian-isis-terror-suspect-arrested-on-milan-metro_c60000da-9d3a-494f-8657-88752558293f.html).
- Iran (Jan. 2024), [ISIS killed 100 people with a suicide bomber](https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/2024/01/09/isis-iran-attack-gaza/).


#### Religion and Money
Religion's role of psychological support for the mass of people inevitably leads to the accumulation of power and wealth, which will be enjoyed by the people at the top of it.

There was a funny episode of South Park about this and [Scientology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_in_the_Closet_(South_Park)), btw.

The religions with the highest estimated amounts of assets belonging include:
- The church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, [200 billion US\$](https://www.newsweek.com/mormon-church-stockpiled-100-billion-intended-charities-misled-lds-members-whistleblower-says-1477809) estimated as of 2021, `200,000,000,000$`. Not too far from the whole market cap of a company like Coca Cola, and both make people happy... :p
- Sadly, there is so much noise about Scientology but they are worth "only" [2 billions \$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wealthiest_religious_organizations), still a lot but 100 times less than the previous one.
- And of course the Vatican... They have so much stuff that it is almost impossible to track the total value of their assets. In 2018 their assets in `Australia alone` were worth [30 billion \$](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-12/catholic-church-worth-$30-billion-investigation-finds/9422246), and they have properties all over the world. Maybe they have reached the trillion (1000 billions) or even more after 2000 years of existence? :)
