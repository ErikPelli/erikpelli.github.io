Uhhhhh history, the chain of events that follow one after another in a perfectly logical way over time,
according to a cause and effect relationship that anyone can see.
But what if it isn't that simple?

### We are the history
`Every second` we breathe is a historical moment, each of us technically is part of the history.
An `ephemera`l history, soon to be forgotten in the second immediately following.
So many small human beings who together unknowingly make up the world.

History is often seen as something distant, an abstract concept written by events that follow a logic,
but the reality is that those who have gone down in history have behaved simply as human beings, and being remembered by
future generations is only the consequence of their actions.

You who are reading this article are part of history, but `you aren't aware` of it.
About an ordinary person, in fact, there is hardly anything left for future generations to study.
Think about this: are there stories in the history books about how some random guy grew wheat or the heroic achievements of `Julius Caesar`?
From that era, we are left with only the stories of nobles and wealthy `Romans` who had some influence (also because the
farmers were illiterate).

Since `no one` is going to `judge` us in the future, why shouldn't we live as we prefer? (Within the limits of the law)

### History Today
Two months ago a historic event happened, the former president Donald `Trump` almost died from the bullet fired by a
boy lying on a rooftop.
An event that will probably be written in the history books, but where were the rest of us while it was happening?
We were watching TV, working, using social media, in short, `nothing different` from what we were doing every other day.
Personally, as soon as I read the news I didn't care so much, I had taken it as normal news, also because in the end he survived.

However, this made me think about our perception of history.
Until then, I thought that the assassination attempt made on `John F. Kennedy` in `1963` was perceived as a shocking event
for people at the time, because that was how the `history books` had explained to me, however most likely the
reaction of the ordinary person was similar to what I had today, a certain indifference after a few days.

Kennedy in the past was the equivalent of Trump today, very `wealthy` family, Republican politician and `hated`
like Trump today by about `half the population` who preferred the Democrats.
If he hadn't died brutally, he would be just like any other president today, but the assassination attempt made him
recognizable `60 years later`, building around him a benevolent aura, almost sanctifying him as a `martyr`, hiding all
the hate he represented while he was alive.

Now that Trump will also be remembered, will future generations think of him as we do about JFK today?

### Ignorance
The `reconstruction` of past populations has been done mainly from `archaeological finds` that have remained intact,
and this is for reasonable reasons.
That is: those who lived in the past are `all dead` :)

We `know a lot` about the Romans, thanks to the large amount of objects and texts found, so much so that to this day in
`Italian schools` the Latin `language` of the Roman aristocracy is still taught (spoiler: it's useless, since throughout the
Roman empire each region used its own dialect).

If we look back to the `Paleolithic` period, all we have are `stone arrowheads` used for hunting
animals, and maybe some `graffiti`, but we could never imagine the world as a nomadic person of that time.
What we have found is what has `stood the test of time`, a bit like `survivorship bias`.
If an ancient people handed down their knowledge exclusively orally, all that information is now `lost forever`.

Even if we find a new archaeological find, we `can't` immediately take it as reliable.
Roman senators did their best to discredit the Roman emperor `Nero`, and today many people believe he was insane.
However, `later`, `historians` realized that they did so only because the emperor wanted to `reduce their power`
and concentrate it in his hands, and that indeed he was a `wise emperor`.

Nowadays, all the knowledge we produce has taken on a new dimension online, in the `last 20 years`
we have increasingly `abandoned` the `physical` world, and now we are inside a `decentralized territory` where at any
moment a website could `disappear` forever.

However, this also allowed the human content to `scale up` to insane levels: no one could read all the posts written on
social media, and this leads us to `overload`.
There is so much information that it's not trivial to `identify` the ones that really matter, and a future historian should
try to use some kind of `scientific method` to separate out the noise (such as `fake news`).

### Winner's History
Those who have enough influence to leave `artifacts` for future generations have the ability to influence the `perceived`
history of that particular era.
History, in fact, always has its own `point of view`, and it's generally the one of the strongest people, since that is
the one that leaves us with most ancient `literature` texts, making us `understand their culture`, as in the case of the Romans.
Today we see the `Roman empire` as one of the `most important` of the past, we study the heroic deeds of its
emperors, and we are `impressed` by them, but perhaps we wouldn't give it such importance if there had been a stronger empire
at the same time.

If Romans had besieged an enemy people and destroyed everything they could find, we wouldn't know today
absolutely anything, if no evidence remains, because we only look at `what is left`.
Did such an event therefore happen? Maybe yes, maybe no, we can't know, but neither can exclude it.

Moreover, also the `present` world `influences` the way we see history.
Thanks to the `victory` of the Americans in `World War II`, we now enjoy democracies in the West where
freedom is an important characteristic.
If we were in some form of dictatorship, however, perhaps we would look at past forms of government with
different eyes, `hating` the `democracy` of the Greeks instead of recognizing it as an advanced form for the time.

If the Nazis had won, the winner's history written in the books would be theirs, and we would look at Americans
as the `villains` in `WW2`, it would be a profoundly `different world`.

### Remembered in History
Unless we are the new Julius Caesar, then, how could we be `sure` that we will `be remembered` by anyone other than
our own family? By the way, a topic we have discussed before in other blog posts.

In ancient Greece, a certain [Herostatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herostratus) thought that a good solution
would be to `burn dow`n one of the most famous temples, which was considered a wonder of the ancient world.
Comparing it to the present day, it is as if someone had destroyed the `Statue of Liberty` or the `Colosseum`, let's
imagine that such an event would be even `worse than 9/11`.

As a punishment, the people of the time `killed him` and established by law that his name would `never be written` anywhere,
to make his desire vain.
However, obviously, if `we know his name`, his plan `worked`!

However, destroying a wonder of the world is not an ethical way to act, and therefore it's necessary to find an
alternative, which, however, doesn't exist.
You have to be a really `influential` person, the kind you can count on the fingers of one hand, and even getting
to that, after a thousand years you will still be forgotten.
Historians in the year `5000` will find our phones buried in the ground, no longer working, and will ask themselves what
they just found.

### History does (not) repeat itself
Although we can carefully `study everything` that has taken place in the past, we will `never be certain` of what
may happen in the immediate future.

In `World War II`, no one expected that a war of that size would break out anytime soon,
everyone thought about striking as soon as possible to destroy the enemy defenses, and they thought that in a few months
there would be a great victory.
After all, that's what happened exactly a `few months ago` with `Ukraine`, and yet we still don't know whether there will be a
`WW3` or whether it will all end soon, despite the fact that we are experiencing it right now.

Rearranging facts and creating a `cause-and-effect` relationship is done only when things have already happened, and
looking at the past it's easy to say that there is always a logical connection.
However, what people really thought just before the `start of World War II` is pretty much what we think today, which is
that we `don't know` how things will evolve.
Now some people are `protesting` about sending guns to Ukraine, just like in the `days of Hitler`, a small part of US citizens
were protesting about sending aid to the UK claiming that the war in Europe `wasn't their business`.

Now, as in the past, knowing the future is impossible, and the only thing we can do is prepare for the worst, as `Taleb`
explains in his book `“The Black Swan”`.
