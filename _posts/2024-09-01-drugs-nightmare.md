title: Drugs Nightmare
---

Finally, a `controversial` topic that we can discuss freely.
Given this premise, we can begin, but I hope we won't randomly forget it in the middle
of the discussion.

## Definition
A drug is a substance that when taken causes certain `effects` from a `biological` point of view.
Said in this way is very vague, so let's go straight to the examples.

`Caffeine` is a `stimulant` drug, which once taken makes us more active and energetic, and is completely `legal`.
`Amphetamine` is also a `stimulant` drug, with an effect `tens` or `hundreds` of times more powerful,
and is currently `illegal` because it's much `stronger` (and it's often abused for recreational purposes).

Based on their effects, there are different `groups` of drugs, but I won't cover them here since we could
stay here for hours.

### Drug vs Drug
In English there is only one word to define both a drug used to treat certain `diseases` (aka `"medicine"`)
and a drug used for `recreational` purposes: `"drug"`.
This isn't always true because in other languages, such as `Italian`, there are `two` totally different `names`
for the 2 categories: (`"farmaco"` or `"medicina"` for the first and `"droga"` for the second, however `"droga"`
doesn't include the medicines in its definition).

However, the `ambiguity` of the English term better represents the `reality`, as there is no clear distinction
between the 2 categories when we just say "drug".
Many `drugs` used for `recreational` purposes are also used as `medicines`, in a `controlled environment` and
with all the appropriate `precautions`.

For example:
- `Ketamine` can be used to treat severe forms of `depression` (in small amounts) or as `anesthetic` (with a much larger dose)
- `Amphetamines` are very effective as a medication for `ADHD` (e.g. `Adderall`)
- `Opioids` (Morphine, etc.) are great `anesthetics` to use for a `surgery`
- `Cocaine` (pure) is used to perform a `local anesthesia`

With certain types of substances the `risk` of `overdose` is greater compared to others,
such as `Fentanyl` where it only takes a few `milligrams` to `die`.

However, this risk shouldn't be underestimated even with medicines such as `paracetamol` (aka Tylenol),
where the `fatal` dose is only `4` / `5` grams (only 10 times a normal dose).
Since paracetamol is among the `most widely used` substances in the world, numerically the `deaths`
caused by this substance aren't just a couple, but no one will ever demonize it because of
the `benefits` it brings us when we are sick.

## Addiction
Each substance can develop an `addiction` in those who use it, and some create one which is stronger
compared to the others (e.g. the addiction caused by `nicotine` in those who smoke `tobacco` is quite strong).

We can distinguish `2 types` of addiction:
- `physical` (e.g., nicotine), where prolonged use of the substance `habituates` our `bodies` to it and
`quitting` can cause `negative effects`. Because of this, it's `difficult` to `stop` using it completely.
- `psychological`, where the addiction lies solely in our mind, and it's our brain that wants to
experience the same feeling again

One substance `can` also `cause both` types of addiction: the `distinction` is `not` always so `clear`.

### Tolerance
Many substances also create `tolerance` in the user.
This means that taking the `same` substance `amount` after a certain period of `time` causes
`weaker` effects, and therefore there is a `risk` that the `person` will `increase` the dose
to experience the same `feeling` again, thus increasing the likelihood of an overdose.

The `period` in which the tolerance remains can be a `few hours` (e.g. meth) or even up to `1 week` (e.g. LSD).

### Psychology
Human psychology is `fundamental` to `understand` the reasons behind the `development` of every addiction.
Basically, it's `never just the substance` that contributes to the worsening of addiction, but an
equally important role is played by the person's lived experiences (`set`) and the environment
where he lives (`setting`).

In drug rehabilitation centers, for example, in addition to administering substances like `methadone` to
reduce the effects of `physical addiction` caused by opioids, they try to give `psychological help` to
people to help them fight the `real causes` that led to the `addiction`.
We must always remember that drug `abuse` is the `effect`, `not` the `cause` of the problem.

Perhaps the `cause` that led to their abuse could be an `unexpected event`, such as the death of a
loved one, or perhaps the need to experience an `escape` from daily worries, work problems, etc.
Every `case` is `different` and needs to be fully `understood` to try to solve it.

### Opioids in the United States
Opioid addiction is getting `out of hand` in the United States, and more and more people are
developing it, with substances such as `Fentanyl`.
In previous years these substances have been prescribed too often by `doctors`, even when there was
`no need`, and more and more people have had access to them.
When the `treatment ended`, however, the `addiction remained`, and very often these people didn't
get help, ending up getting their supplies for personal usage from the `black market`, building their
lives around drug addiction.

### Opportunity cost
When you decide to use drugs for recreational purposes, you need to calculate what `costs` you are
facing, to really understand the situation and become `discouraged` from using them in the `long term`.

Here I am referring only to `monetary` costs, excluding any long term health effects.
For example, if you decide to use a substance such as LSD, you have to calculate at least `1 day` of
work lost and `2` more to `recover` energy after the experience.

Considering that a `freelancer` IT consultant can charge `$500 - $1000` per `day`, this means that
using it means a `loss` of a few `thousand $`, every time you use it.
It can certainly be `fun`, but is such an experience really worth `$3000`? Maybe not...

## Alcohol culture
Alcohol has been part of our lives for `thousands of years` and is a cultural fixture:
think for example about `beers` in Germany or `wine` in Italy.
It's so much important there that families incite `children` to `try` them for the first
time when they are young.

In the `Code of Hammurabi`, the ancient Babylonians wrote that anyone who tried to dilute
`beer` with water deserved the death penalty, because `fermentation` process killed
`bacteria` and adding water caused people to die from `dysentery`.

There are also proverbs from the ancient `Romans` that mention `wine`, such as
`"In Vino Veritas"`, which refers to the fact that a `drunk` person will tell
the `truth` about what he thinks.

But is it really as harmless as people say?

When we `metabolize` alcohol once we ingest it, our `liver` converts it into `Acetaldehyde`,
a substance much more `carcinogenic` than alcohol itself, which is responsible for the `hangover`.

However, how can its dangerousness be `compared` to that of other `drugs`?
There isn't currently a standard for doing so, and there aren't many studies on this topic.
One of the most `famous` and comprehensive is the one published from `The Lancet`, which dates
back to `2010`, 15 years ago, and is cited almost everywhere when we talk about this topic.
The `chart` below is a `summary` of its data.

|                                              ![Drug harms](/assets/img/blog/2024-09-01-drugs-nightmare/drugs-harm.png)                                               | 
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:| 
| *["Drug harms in the UK: a multicriteria decision analysis", 2010, The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)61462-6/abstract)* |

The first reaction we have looking at this chart is: whaaaaaat? alcohol is even more dangerous
than heroin? How?

Let's add some `context` to the study results:
- `"harm to users"`, which is the `damage` caused to the people who use it, both in the `short` and `long` term
- `"harm to others"`, which includes the effects these substances have on the `people around` the user,
including indirect physical harm (e.g. `fights` caused by increased `violence`), destruction of `families`,
loss of `friends`, etc.

If we consider only the `first` of the two, alcohol ranks approximately between methamphetamine and
cocaine: the `damage` it causes to the `liver` is not so insignificant (it can even lead to death),
and this is why a `moderate use` is recommended, to reduce its damage.

However, this doesn't mean we can `justify` the use of cocaine with the fact that it's `less` dangerous
than alcohol: I'm `not saying` this at all, each of these substances causes `damage` to our bodies and
`avoiding` them altogether can only be `good` for us.
Trying them only `once`, however, doesn't mean ruining our lives, and sometimes a `mindful use` convinces
us that we `don't need` them to live a `peaceful` life, after all.

## Crowd
When people group themselves together and become a crowd, the whole group `intelligence` decreases,
as `Gustave Le Bon` suggested in his book `"Psychology of Crowds"`, written more than a century ago.
`Mussolini` took inspiration from this book to successfully `control` people's `lives`, by transforming
italian population into one `big crowd`.

Crowds can be easily `manipulated` with `slogans` and simple words, `obeying` a leader,
whether it's a dictator or a DJ who does `"crowd control"`.
The `intelligence` of the group reaches the one of the `dumbest` people inside it, who are the
`target` audience.

This behaviour increases the number of `stupid actions`, such as taking drugs in order to feel
more `connected` with the `group`.
Therefore, in a music `festival`, the `target` audience are those who can't do any logical reasoning
at that moment, because they have taken some `drug`.
If the crowd decides to do something `stupid`, they are ready to be influenced and put their `ideas` into
`practice`.

## Illegality
This is a `black market`, which has developed due to the fact that the products traded are `illegal`, and
the majority of the market is controlled by crime.
Each clan operates in its own `territory` and controls it with `violence`, eliminating any threat that
might compete with them.

This is a great topic for `movies` and TV series (`Gomorrah`, `Narcos`, etc.) because it attracts people, but
in reality there is nothing good if the violence that is shown there happens to you, maybe because you are
just in the `wrong place` at the `wrong time` and an exchange of person is made.

Criminals have a certain `reputation` to maintain in order to show themselves `strong`, and if you offend them
they `don't easily forget`: they will follow you until you are `alone` in an `isolated place` months or years later.
If they don't respond to provocations, they appear `weak` in the eyes of `rivals`, and this isn't acceptable.

### Prohibition era
Many people compare the illegality of `drugs` nowadays to the `Prohibition` era in the `United States`, which remained
in force from `1920` to `1933`, in which all `alcohol` was `banned` and couldn't be used (legally) at all.

The consumption of alcohol instead of decreasing remained constant or even increased, as the `penalties weren't
enough `to deter people from consuming it and there were various ways to `bypass` it, such as solid bricks of grapes
to create [wine inside a closet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine-Glo).

Moreover, thanks to this law, `gangsters` expanded their control over the United States (one of the most famous
was `Al Capone`) through the sale of `contraband` alcohol.
`Clandestine bars` appeared, where illegally produced concentrated spirits were served, such as `Moonshine`,
with a % of alcohol reaching `60 - 70%`.
The higher, the better, because `less liquid` is needed to have the same `effects` and with a smaller amount it
was much easier to `transport` compared to `beer`, which usually contains less than `5%` alcohol.

Because there was `no control` over their production, there have been cases of `methanol poisoning`,
perhaps because it was added as an `additive` to make the drink seem more alcoholic than it is,
but it's a `toxic substance` that causes `permanent damages` even in small amounts.

Once Prohibition was over, the `appeal` of illegality was gone, there was no longer that feeling of doing 
something `forbidden`.
Perhaps fewer people wanted to use it, given also the `negative effects` it causes on health
(which, however, were little known at the time). 
In recent years, alcohol consumption has `dropped` dramatically in the `young population`,
alcohol no longer attracts even though it's available in any supermarket, and products like
`non-alcoholic` beers and alcohol-free gin are emerging.

### War on drugs
Thanks to the `people` who `finance` these criminal groups with their drug purchases, they have been able to
strengthen themselves to the point of posing a real `threat `to the whole `community` because of their criminal
methods.

Since the `1980s`, countries in the Western world (`U.S.`, `Europe`, etc.) have been trying to `combat` this
phenomenon with military operations, `seizures` and arrests.
However, the shipments intercepted are `few` compared to their total number and the `profit` made from the sale
is `hundreds` of times what the cost of production is, leading to absurd amounts of money for those involved in
`distribution`.
This means that they can offer `millions of $` to the right people and continue to act `undisturbed` in their task.

As long as the `status quo` remains, they already know their market and have virtually `no competition`:
they currently have a `monopoly`.
Convincing people of the dangerousness of drugs and why they shouldn't be legal is part of the game, to keep
the power, everything is in `their interest`.

`Liberalizing` means bringing this black market into the `capitalist` system, allowing anyone to compete,
which means having `more controls` and `security`, but it would be the `ruin` of the criminal gangs,
as they would `no longer` have `exclusivity` and they would lose the immense `profits`.

Recently, `protest movements` for the legalization of `cannabis` have been emerging, and they are trying to
promote `referendums` to make it effective.
In the long term this `will` probably `happen`, given its mild effects and considering that it's `difficult` to
transport illegally since it `occupies` a lot of `space`, making it of `little interest` to criminal groups.
The criminals are probably `against` legalizing it because they fear that once it's legal, protesters
will move on to `other types` of substances, and this wouldn't be good for their `business`.

Of course, this is my `personal opinion` and maybe in the future things will change, however, criminals will
always be `present`, and they are always ready to expand into new `markets`: they used to make money mainly from
`kidnappings`, then they discovered drugs and since they have always kept a `low profile`,
and it almost seems as if they don't exist, until it's `too late`.

## Folly
Reading the book `"In Praise of Folly"` by `Erasmus` of Rotterdam, I immediately saw the connection with
this theme.
According to him, in fact, every man need `folly` to `escape` the everyday life and be happy
while enjoying the `pleasures` of life.
`Drugs` (including alcohol) are the `easiest` way to obtain it, as you leave your rational side and
become `unpredictable`, uncontrollable.

A person who wants to try a `hallucinogenic` substance like LSD for the first time truly understands
what `insanity` is, as it becomes a part of him.
However, this `doesn't mean` that he is a stoner or a `crazy` person: the effect is only `temporary`,
and after 1 day he returns to his `daily life`, the fact that he experienced this certainly doesn't
make him a bad person.
The fact that he chose this particular substance, moreover, is `better` than the other `alternatives`,
since in the study we mentioned earlier it's ranked as one of those that causes the `least harm` to
health.

Statistically, almost `1 in 2 people` have tried substances other than simple alcohol in an attempt to
find their folly, even if they `don't admit` it.
These people include me, and I'm not afraid to admit it, and I'm writing a whole blog article about
this topic.

### Manipulation
There are certain people who take advantage of others' `weaknesses` to convince them to try hard drugs
and try to `extort` money / favors from them with the threat of publishing `photos` showing this action,
because the scammed person will lose his `credibility` if the facts become public.

They can, for example, `take advantage` of the lack of friends, making you believe they share certain
ideas until they `convince` you to meet them in person.
These things work as long as there is someone willing to `pay for silence` and, if you pay, you will
give even more `power` to `blackmailers`, because they can always `ask` for something `new` to keep
their `silence`.

So I decided to `not care` and talk about it directly in a `transparent` way, so I'm sure
there are no secrets to hide.
I don't think I did anything wrong and what happened to me served as a `lesson` to improve.

Currently, I'm completely `sober`, I have severely limited the alcohol I consume, and eliminated
any kind of drugs from my life after the various `negative experiences` that happened,
including being followed at night by a dozen people in Bulgaria.
