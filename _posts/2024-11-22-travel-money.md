In the previous article about [forex](/blog/2024-08/forex-midmarket)
we had seen that the foreign currency exchange market is actually a
decentralized market, with no central authority setting the price.

This means that there will always be those who will try to monetize on
unsuspecting tourists, who will find themselves spending money unnecessarily,
and from my experience, they are quite a lot.

## Always avoid
The following places should be avoided at all costs because of the `absurd
fees` they charge to squeeze money out of tourists' pockets.

### Airport money exchanges
I was once on a trip with some people who really believed the `"0% fees"`
advertisement from an airport kiosk, and it didn't seem true to me that
they were so `uninformed`: when I pointed it out to them, they even told me
I was being conspiratorial to say it was a `false advertisement` (lol).
Anyway, this `scam` is based on the fact that when a person arrives in a
`new country`, he doesn't know where to go or what to do, so they `exchange`
their travel cash money at the `first place` they see.

A `store` inside the airport is very `expensive to rent`, considering the
income it carries, and so everyone `SHOULD` ask himself a couple of
questions about how they make money.

Assuming you want to exchange `1$` (USD) for a bogus currency
called `FKE`, which at that moment in the currency exchange market
is worth `0.5$`.
If it's truly a `0 commission` exchange, with `1$` you expects to receive `2 FKE`.
However, they say that at that time, `for them`, the exchange rate is
`1$` for `1.5 FKE`, and they charge you `0 commission` on the exchange
using `this` conversion.
If, on the contrary, you have money left over at the `end of the trip` in the
same exact moment, the exchange will `magically` be `reversed`, and
for every `2.5 FKE` you give them, they will give you `1$` back.

`Technically` the advertisement is `correct`, but they are referring
to the commission on the exchange rate they themselves proposed,
and the actual `real fees` (aka `spread`) in this example is `25%`,
basically you're giving them 1/4 of your money (`!!!`).

In reality, the exchange rate is usually worse `"only"` by `10 to 15%`
which is still a very high commission.
The `same thing` applies to money exchanges near the `road border`
between two `countries` with different currencies, for those traveling by car.

### Euronet ATMs

| ![Euronet ATM](/assets/img/blog/2024-11-22-travel-money/euronet.jpg) |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                       *Example of Russian ATM*                       |

`Euronet` is an American company that places `compact ATMs` around
the world, but they have even `higher fees` than `airports`.

Pay attention to them the next time you `walk around` any city, they are
commonly found near tobacco shops, `bars`, restaurants, `hotels`, etc.,
and they pay a `rent` to the `owner` of the business in which they are housed.

These ATMs are a real `cash cow` for the company, usually charging a
fixed fee of `5 - 10€ per withdrawal` + a `mandatory %` on currency
exchange of `~15%`, billing your card for the € amount after this conversion.

Their  `target` is usually those who go to a restaurant and find their card
declined (`urgency`) or perhaps those who simply want to get a small
amount of money and `know nothing` about what awaits them.

## Options before traveling
OK, we've seen the options that should always be avoided.
Now let's explore the options available `before` we even `start` our journey.
What can we `do` when we are still at `home`? Can we maybe `sign up`
for some card that will `save` us `money`?

### Banks
Usually banks agree to sell you foreign currency at the market price,
in exchange for a `fixed fee` of about ~10€, which is very convenient
in the case of `large amounts`: if you change 100€, the commission is 10%,
but if you change 10,000, this is only 0.1%.
If you might be interested in such a service, you should start by
`investigating` about banks that offer this service in `your area`.

### Brokers
If you have an account with an `investment broker`, it's worth investigating
their currency exchange fees, since they could be `very low`.

In the case of [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/pricing/commissions-spot-currencies.php),
one of the largest in the world, the commission is only `0.2 basis points`,
which means `0.002%` of the total, nothing in the rest of the list achieves a
commission that low.

However, if you use Interactive Brokers only for currency exchange operations,
after a while they will limit your account, and it's therefore necessary to
have a `real` investment `account` and treat the exchange as only something minor.

To `spend` the converted amount after the exchange, you need to `transfer`
it to a `bank account` that supports the currency, and perhaps have a `card`
linked, so you can spend the money while traveling.
Since `free bank transfers` through the `SEPA` circuit `only` support
`Euros` (thank you, EU!), there may be a `fee` for `moving money` through
other bank transfer circuits (e.g. `SWIFT`).

### Credit & debit cards
It's possible to make payments with a `regular card` abroad, however,
there are `fees` to consider.
`Mastercard` and Visa offer a `currency exchange` service to `card-issuing
banks`, and basically all of them use it.

In the case of Mastercard, there is a [website](https://www.mastercard.com/global/en/personal/get-support/convert-currency.html)
where we can see the exchange rate they `apply`.
Taking the `Euro` - `Polish zloty` exchange rate of the `previous day` as
an example (the website is `updated` only `once a day`),
we can see that while the `current` exchange rate listed on XE.com is
`1€ `= `4.343zł`, the exchange rate provided by `Mastercard` is `4.327zł`.
Basically, when we need to `spend` the `same amount` of zł,
with the `Mastercard conversion` it costs us `0.35% more` once we
convert the amount to Euros.

In addition to this, the `bank` charges `its own commission` of choice on the
currency exchange made with the card, usually `around 3%`, so the actual
`final commission` is about `~3.40%` (including Mastercard exchange spread).
`American Expres`s cards are `not that convenient` either, they promote
themselves as ideal cards for travelers and then `almost no one accepts them`
(because they charge `higher merchant fees`) and on `currency exchange `
they charge a whopping `2.5%`.

### Card aggregators
There is a service, Curve, that gives you a `physical card` without its own
associated bank account, and this card `forwards payments` to `another`
existing Visa or Mastercard `card` issued from your bank.

The convenient part is that `before forwarding` them, Curve `converts` the
amount to be paid to the currency of the card, using the `Mastercard
exchange rate`, without any fee added.

So if your bank applies the Mastercard `+ 3%` exchange rate, using this
aggregator service will `save` you the `3%` (but, as we have seen, the
Mastercard exchange rate is slightly worse than the current one, so the
`0.3` / `0.4%` fee, aka spread, is present anyway).

### Travel debit cards
There are some debit cards designed specifically for travelers,
including Wise and Revolut, which `don't use` the currency exchange `rate`
provided by `Visa` or `Mastercard` but, instead, `handle` it `themselves`
and the conversion rates are generally slightly `better`.

Considering the current `Euro` - `Polish` zloty exchange rate (`1€` = `4.33429 zł`),
the 2 cards offer us respectively:
```
1€ =
Revolut   4.3240 zł  (-0.23%) 
Wise        4,3340 zł  (-0.005%)
```

Both fees are `lower` than the exchange rate applied by Mastercard,
but right now, for this specific currency, the exchange rate applied by Wise
is `really good`, less than 0.01%, although they are both good options and
at certain times Revolut's exchange rate might be the better one.

However, when you use `Wise`, they apply a `"conversion fee"` to offer
you the great exchange rate (usually `0.5%` - `0.7%`, [0.64%](https://wise.com/it/pricing/hold-fees?sourceAmount=1000&sourceCcy=PLN&targetCcy=EUR)
for zloty) and, as a result, it's `less convenient` in our example (0.23% vs 0.64%).

## Local options
You are in the `middle` of your `trip` and `need money` in the local currency,
what are the possible `options`?

### Pay directly with strong currency (when accepted)
If you go to some `small Eastern European` country, such as Bulgaria,
it may happen that when you go to the `restauran`t there are notices where
it's specified that they `also accept Euros` directly, to accommodate tourists
who may not have changed their money.

A similar thing happens, for example, in some `South American` countries
with the `Dollar`, since it is perceived as `safer`.
However, it must be `mentioned` that the `Bulgarian Lev - Euro` exchange
rate has been `stable` in the last 10 years, and they are `planning` to `adopt`
`Euro` as well, so this certainly `doesn't apply` in `every country` you visit.

### ATM Withdrawal
With services such as Wise or Revolut, you can make a certain number
of `ATM withdrawals` for `free`, using their exchange rate, which is
`very convenient`, as we have seen (it isn't the Mastercard/Visa exchange rate).

However, the ATM from which you withdraw must be configured to `not
charge` fees on cards not belonging to that bank: if this is the case,
you will be `notified` when trying to withdraw.

You always have to get a good `city` walking `tour` before you find a
decent bank that doesn't apply it, I `always withdraw` some cash (~10/20€)
because they can be `useful`.
From my experience, some of the `foreign ATMs` that do not charge withdrawal
fees are for example those of [Banco Bradesco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Bradesco)
in Brazil and [Ardshinbank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardshinbank) in Armenia.

### Local banks
It's always possible to go to a `local bank` in the `cities` you visit and get some
local currency cash, giving Euro `banknotes` or (sometimes) paying with your `card`,
using their exchange rate.
However, the `exchange rate` they charge is `not the best `compared
to other available options.

### Street exchange

| ![Street Exchange](/assets/img/blog/2024-11-22-travel-money/street-exchange.png) | 
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                          *Street Exchange in Venezuela*                          |

Here I include only those countries where there is an `unofficial exchange rate,`
such as `Argentina` and `Venezuela`, where the` local currency sucks` so badly
that its citizens are willing to do anything to `get rid` of it in order to buy
`foreign` currency, which is considered more `stable`.
These countries `printed` more `money `than they could afford to do,
to `repay` their previous `debts`, and now they are `paying `the `consequences`.

If you pay using a `credit card` you will in fact have an exchange rate 
hat is generally `30 / 40% worse` (the official one) than you would have
by exchanging Euros or Dollars for local cash at these `street` exchanges,
which are basically people on the street with `stacks of banknotes` ready
to be exchanged.

### Western Union
It's possible to book a `cash withdrawal` a few days in advance (minimum 3)
at a Western Union point present in the `country` you are going to`visit`,
convenient to safely obtain a `large amount` of cash, but with not
insignificant fees (`5` - `10%`).

### Exchange kiosk
Here I am referring to the classic currency `exchange stores` around the city
that accept Euros in cash and give you the local currency.
You should definitely `avoid` those placed in the `touristic area`, as they
will ask for a `spread` on the `exchange rate` up to `10%` (nice `high` commission, right?).
The `best` ones are in a `suburban` area frequented mostly by `locals`.

For Armenia there is a `site` that shows the exchange rates of each kiosk
in real time with its `location`, called [rate.am](https://www.rate.am/en/armenian-dram-exchange-rates/exchange-points),
I haven't found any other country with something like this.
They can be really `convenient` for `currencies` of `small countries`
such as Armenia: at the time I am writing, the average `exchange rate`
on XE.com is `1€ = 405 ֏`, cards like Revolut probably give you a
`slightly worse` exchange rate, around `~400 ֏`.
On the kiosks listed on that site, they offer you an even `better`
exchange rate than the official one (currently `1€ = 408 ֏`), keep this
option in mind.

However, you have to be careful to `count` the `money` right when they
give the cash to you, directly on the `counter`, without putting it in your
`wallet` immediately.
It's `common` for them to accidentally `"forget"` to give you some banknotes,
so it's always recommended to `use` the `calculator` before going there,
or there's a 90% chance to get `fooled` because you are a tourist.
When you `remark` that a part of what you expected is `missing`,
immediately you will be `given the rest`, because otherwise `they` would
be on the `wrong side`.
However, if they still do this, it means that `many` people `don't notice` it,
and `they` have only to `gain` from it.

## Emergency options
What can be done in case of emergency?
I once happened to find myself with `all` my `cards` blocked due to
movements considered suspicious by the bank and with `not enough
cash` at all to cover travel expenses.
Here's what I did.

### 1
I immediately converted my `emergency fund` (50€ cash) to local currency
using one of the previously mentioned kiosks.
After all, this is the `purpose` of the `emergency` fund, which I `recommend`
to always have.
It should, however, be kept in a `safe place` and not in your wallet,
as you `might` also `need` it in the hypothetical event that you are `robbed`.

### 2
You can open an `online bank account` in minutes that doesn't need a
physical card to be used, such as Revolut.

You `sign up`, get `verified` with your documents, `transfer` a few hundred
euros to your `account` IBAN and then use a virtual card linked to something
like `Google Pay` to pay contactless with your `phone` in the stores.

### 3
Ask for an emergency `cash withdrawal` using services such as `Ria` or
`Xoom`, quite similar to Western Union.

It will take `2` or `3 days`, and you have to pay a quite high commission (`~10%`),
but if you have `no alternative` you are happy to pay them as long as
you `get` enough `money` for the trip.
