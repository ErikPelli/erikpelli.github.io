I have been traveling as a `backpacker` for some time, and in doing so, I have gained
some experience about its planning.
I have made a `list` for myself of the things that have been `essentia`l during
my travels: whenever I realized that I didn't have an item that was
useful, I `added` it to the list for the `next` trip.

## Useful things
- [Travel money](/blog/2024-11/travel-money)
- `Deodorant` stick
- Cotton swabs (aka Q-Tips)
- `Passport` / ID Card
- Photocopy of the document to request a new one from the consulate, if lost
- Tissues
- Any book to read during breaks
- Phone charger
- `Powerbank`
- `USB-C cables`
- Laptop portable mouse
- Earphones for music
- 1 clothespin, to close food packages
- 1 normal pen to write anything
- `Toothbrush`
- 10ml perfume spray bottle
- Small portable umbrella
- Beer bottle opener
- Cigarettes to offer for free (although I don't smoke) & lighter

## Clothes
There can be `several cases` when deciding the amount of clothes to bring along,
depending on the `length` of the trip.

- `<= 3 days`, only one `backpack`, with all the stuff listed above and few clothes
- `<= 3 weeks`, one `backpack` + `10kg trolley`
- `<= 2 months`, one `backpack` + `20kg trolley`

When you bring a `trolley` with you, you can take a much `larger amount` of
clean `clothes`, but you will be `less flexible` with luggage movements.
In any case, when allowed, you can `wash clothes` in the middle of the trip.

### Small towel
OOOOO the towel, the `most important` object according to
`The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy`.
It's actually one of the most useful items, and on a `backpacker` trip,
you will `almost never` get a clean one other than `what you bring`.

`Careful followers` of this blog as soon as they go to a `hostel` complain
that having one for `rent costs a lot`, since they `didn't know` they had to
`bring it` with them....
Be careful about this detail, a clean `towel` brought from home can
drastically `improve` the `experience`.

### Bathrobe
There is enough space to put it `only` if it is a `long term` trip with a
`trolley` included, in addition to the backpack.
If the trip lasts only a `few days`, you have to `give it up`.

### Disposable K-Way
It `isn't` always `possible` to use an `umbrella` in rainy weather, such as when
there is a `crowd` of people, for `safety issues`.
Having a disposable plastic K-Way is `useful` for situations like this,
and they cost only a few `tens of cents`, `online`.

## Water bottle
It's always a good idea to carry an `empty bottle` with you, to be filled
in the `drinking fountain` (or toilets) immediately `after` airport `security` checks.
Better if it's `thermally insulated`, so the water remains cool.

## Liquid bag
We have a total of `1L per person` available, divided into bottles where
each one is maximum `100ml`.
Always put a tube of `toothpaste` inside the bag.

If the trip lasts only a few days, put a `few bottles` of shower gel such as
refilled `free samples` from hotels, the amount will be enough.
If it's a `long term` trip, it's better to directly `buy` a new shower gel 
when you arrive `in the destination` and throw away the leftover
at the end of the trip, since we cannot take it with us.

## Padlock
A padlock is `essential` while traveling, to `avoid` being `robbed` when you
leave your items unattended or if your room doesn't provide a locker.
It's recommended that you bring `more than one` padlock, strictly
`key-openable` and `not` with a 3-digit `combination`, since it's easy to guess it.
Once the lock is closed, the `key` should `always` be `with you`.

## [Toothbrush caps](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=toothbrush+caps)
Sometimes I `forgot` to bring with me the `toothbrush`, and in that case I
would `buy another` one during the trip.

However, when I had to put it away in my backpack after I used it, I had
`no cap` to put on top to `protect it` from dust, and I just used a tissue.
Since that day, I always leave `toothbrush caps` in my `backpack`,
that I can use in cases like this.

## Adapters
### USB-A to USB-C adapter

|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                              *USB Adapter*                              |

This adapter is essential to `charge` your phone (or powerbank) when traveling
on `public transportation` (e.g. `bus`).
In fact, it's very `common` to find the outdated `USB Type A` sockets,
and the `adapter` in the photo is the `only solution`.

### Travel power adapter

|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                               *Different Plug Types*                                |

When traveling, it's common to go to a country that has `different electrical sockets`
from those in your home country, so it's helpful to always have a
`universal adapter` with you, that will just do the job.

Personally, I `always` carry a `GaN` type adapter called [Swift](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iblockcube/swift-pro-the-powerful-140w-4th-gen-gan-travel-adapter),
for which I spent `~90€`.
In the `same size` as a regular travel adapter, it also includes a `power supply`
with `USB-C ports` that supports a maximum of `140W`, and is therefore
capable of charging `2 laptops` and `1 smartphone` at the same time,
`saving` me a lot of `space` inside my backpack.

I had been looking for a charger with `these features` for a long time and,
as the result of my own searches, this is the `only one` for sale.

## Sleep kit
If `someone` in the same room `snores` while sleeping, and it's impossible
to sleep, it may be necessary to wear `earplugs`, but they `aren't supposed`
to be used `regularly`, because they are `uncomfortable`, especially if you
keep them for `10 hours`.

Same applies for the `sleeping mask`: it's `uncomfortable` to wear but
if the room `lacks curtains`, it's essential if you don't want to be woken up by `sunlight`.
I personally `never carry` it with me, but it `can be useful` in some cases.

## Country flag
It can be useful to always have a `flag` of your `country` with you,
so that you can `show` your `origin` while traveling.
It can be carried to `clubs`, randomly shaken on the `streets`, put over your `bed`, etc.
If some `local` person `stops` you on the street asking for `directions`
in his `local language`, you can `excuse yourself` by showing the flag,
making clear that you are only a `tourist`.

## Chloroform
> ⚠️ To be used in case of emergency, and only for defense

If you are `alone`, in an `isolated` place, and whoever stops you on the
street has `unfriendly` intentions and won't let you go after you show the `flag`,
you can use the chloroform you brought with you to `stun` him and escape unharmed.
Since it's a `transparent` liquid, just put it in a `small bottle` in your `liquid bag`,
and no one will notice the difference.
You can make it yourself by mixing bleach and acetone.

## Attitude
Usually backpackers travel `alone`, and they're open to `dialogue` and `sharing`.
To enrich your experience, do it too, be `kind`, `without faking` it, otherwise
others will notice it.
Share your experiences for the sake of it, and `never expect anything`
in return, or you will be disappointed.

> P.S. If you lend money, consider it as a gift, you won't see them again :D
