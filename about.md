## About

I'm a Software Engineer from Italy who has been experimenting with programming problems for years and I enjoy finding effective solutions for each one: you can see some of my projects in my GitHub profile.

I'm also an occasional open source contributor in other projects, and for example I have made some proposals for code changes that have been accepted and are now part of the Go programming language.
