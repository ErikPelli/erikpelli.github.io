# 📝 About me
I'm an **italian student** who has been experimenting with programming problems for years
and I enjoy finding effective solutions for each one: you can see some of my projects in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/ErikPelli).
I attended the ["ITI Francesco Severi"](https://itiseveripadova.edu.it) high school, with a specialization in Information Technology.

I am currently deeply concentrating on learning how to use the **Go language** well, and I think it's nice.
I recently started studying some books about _Computer Science_, to get a theoretical basis that will be useful in the future.
