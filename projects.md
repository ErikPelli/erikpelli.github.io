## [\[C\#\] McTazze](https://github.com/McTazze)
![McTazze](projects/mctazze.png)

McTazze is a program that generates random (but valid, thanks to the generation algorithm) McDonald's italian coffee promocode and insert them in some accounts registered on their website. Accounts are taken from a JSON file that contains emails and cookies of the account session.
However, McDonalds added a Google Captcha verification after 1 month, so I decided to release his full code for educational purposes.
Before that, it was able to completely fill the coupon slots of _500 accounts in about 2 minutes_.

### [McCafe Locations](https://github.com/ErikPelli/McCafe-Locations)
McCafe Locations is a simple Python script linked to McTazze and, starting from the files published on the McDonald's website, it compares the locations of restaurants and eliminates those that don't have a cafeteria, producing an output JSON file usable by mctazze.


## [\[Java\] MiZipGen](https://github.com/MiZipGen)
MiZipGen is a Java library that calculates all the keys for the Mifare tag of the MiZip vending key. 

It's based on `https://github.com/iceman1001/proxmark3/blob/master/client/scripts/calc_mizip.lua`, but this is in clean Java code.
