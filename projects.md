## [\[C\] SRIX4K Reader](https://github.com/ErikPelli/SRIX4K-Reader)
![NFC](projects/nfc.png)

SRIX4K Reader is a program to read, modify and write SRIX4K and ST25TB04K NFC tags, which are contained in everyday products.
This project, unlike all the other similar ones on GitHub, follows all the guidelines imposed by the [ST datasheet](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/st25tb04k.pdf), including the rereading of the written data, to preserve the data integrity, and the division of the NFC tag's EEPROM into different logical zones with different permissions.

This program relies on "libnfc" library to interact with the NFC reader and the NFC tag, but due to its modularity, the library for the reader can be easily changed in the future.

## [\[Go\] Goombagram - suspended](https://github.com/GoombaGram/GoombaGram)
![Telegram](projects/telegram.png)

GoombaGram is a library written entirely in Go that interfaces directly with Telegram servers and acts as a Telegram client, thus allowing you to manage an account and automate actions.

Its development has been suspended, some parts have been developed but it's currently incomplete.

### [TL parser JSON](https://github.com/GoombaGram/TL-parser-JSON)
TL parser JSON is a parser linked to Goombagram that parse a Telegram .tl scheme file and produce and output JSON file, which has the same format as those used by Telegram.

## [\[C\#\] McTazze](https://github.com/McTazze)
![McTazze](projects/mctazze.png)

McTazze is a program that generates random (but valid, thanks to the generation algorithm) McDonald's italian coffee promocode and insert them in some accounts registered on their website. Accounts are taken from a JSON file that contains emails and cookies of the account session.

However, McDonalds added a Google Captcha verification after 1 month, so I decided to release his full code for educational purposes.
Before that, it was able to completely fill the coupon slots of _500 accounts in about 2 minutes_.

### [McCafe Locations](https://github.com/ErikPelli/McCafe-Locations)
McCafe Locations is a simple Python script linked to McTazze and, starting from the files published on the McDonald's website, it compares the locations of restaurants and eliminates those that don't have a cafeteria, producing an output JSON file usable by mctazze.

## [\[Java\] MiZipGen](https://github.com/MiZipGen)
MiZipGen is a Java library that calculates all the keys for the Mifare tag of the MiZip vending key. 

It's based on `https://github.com/iceman1001/proxmark3/blob/master/client/scripts/calc_mizip.lua`, but this is in clean Java code.
