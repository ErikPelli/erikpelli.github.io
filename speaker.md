### [Devfest Venezia](https://devfest24.gdgvenezia.it/speakers/erik-pellizzon/) - Venice, 16th November

#### The rise of green threads (English)
In recent years, more and more programming languages are introducing
green threads internally, a type of concurrency that is built by abstracting
native OS threads using the language's runtime.

They may have various names, but the concept is always almost the same:
coroutines, virtual threads (Java 1.19+), goroutines (Go), fibers (PHP), etc.

But... Why? As we will see, they are great for I/O bound tasks, and we will
analyze the logic behind Go's implementation, which is one of the most mature.
